[OpenCon](https://www.opencon2018.org) is the international conference on open access to scientific and academic knowledge, open education and open data, aimed especially at students and those in their first years of academic professional career. It is an event organized by the [Right to Research Coalition](http://righttoresearch.org/), [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org) (The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) and an Organizing Committee composed of students and young academic professionals from various parts of the world.

[OpenCon LatAm](https://www.opencon2018.org/opencon_2018_latam) is one of the 25 satellite events of the global conference, where we tackle regional problems and challenges in open access, open education and open data that matter to us. It had its first edition in Mexico City in 2017 and this year it will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The event will include panels of national and regional experts, such as **Dominique Babini (CLACSO, Latam)**, **Diego Gómez (Colombia)**, **Javiera Atenas (OFKN education e ILDA, UK)**, among others. There will be discussion sessiones, hands-on workshops and webinars around the three main axes: knowledge, education and data.

OpenCon is more than a conference: It’s a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.

## How can I collaborate with OpenCon LatAm?

This event is possible thanks to the contribution of institutions and people who value the benefits of training the next generation of researchers and education professionals within the open culture. We contemplate different participation schemes, don’t hesitate to contact us.

**Your contribution helps keeping active the long tradition of openness and democratization of science and education in our region!**
