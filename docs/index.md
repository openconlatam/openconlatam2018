[OpenCon](https://www.opencon2018.org) is the international conference on open access to scientific and academic knowledge, open education and open data organised by the [Right to Research Coalition](http://righttoresearch.org/), [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org) (The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) and young academic professionals from different parts of the world.

[OpenCon LatAm](https://www.opencon2018.org/opencon_2018_latam) is one of the 25 satellite events of the global conference, where we tackle regional problems and challenges in open access, open education and open data that matter to us. It had its first edition in Mexico City in 2017 and this year it will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

*OpenCon is more than a conference: It’s a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information—from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.*

## We need your help to make OpenCon Latam 2018 possible.
